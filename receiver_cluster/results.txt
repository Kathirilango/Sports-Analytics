Using three principal components and three clusters, the final data can be seen in the 
clustered_data.csv file. The three tiers of receivers that were created can essentially 
be described as:

- Cluster 1: Tight ends and YAC monsters (211 players)
    - do not lead the team in share of air yards, typically create more separation, work 
      closer to the line of scrimmage, but have more yards after catch per reception than any other 
      cluster
    - examples: Randall Cobb (2016-19), Mohamed Sanu (2016-19), Taylor Gabriel (2016-18), 
      George Kittle (2017 and 19), Deebo Samuel (2019)

- Cluster 2: Unproductive speedsters and old/injured stars (156 players)
    - more targeted air yards than any other cluster, but lower catch % and less YAC/R, rather 
      unproductive for various reasons and typically the number 3 or 4 option
    - mostly one-dimensional and unproductive speedsters
        - examples: Ted Ginn, Mike Williams, Phillip Dorsett, Curtis Samuel, John Ross, 
          Calvin Ridley, and Marquise Goodwin
    - Also includes formerly good players whose age limited their roles 
        - examples: Gronk (2018), Jimmy Graham (2017), Jeremy Maclin (2017), 
          Jordy Nelson (2017), Michael Crabtree (2017), Victor Cruz (2016)
    - Lastly includes great players who got injured that season and thus appear to be unproductive
        - examples: Adam Thielen (2019), Alshon Jeffrey (2019), Doug Baldwin (2018), 
          AJ Green (2018), Emmanuel Sanders (2017) 

- Cluster 3: The best receivers in football, true Number 1's (139 players)
    - Lead league in share of team's air yards, catches, targets, yards, and touchdowns
    - examples: Antonio Brown (2016-18), Julio Jones (2016-19), Michael Thomas (2016-19), 
      DeAndre Hopkins (2016-19), Travis Kelce (2016-19), Amari Cooper (2016-19), OBJ (2016, 18-19), 
      Jarvis Landry (2016-19), Tyreek Hill (2017-19)

Additional Notes:
- The clusters can also show development from receivers over the years. For instance, Tyler Lockett 
  was a Cluster 1 receiver in 2016 and 2017 but transitioned into a Cluster 3 receiver in 2018 and 
  2019 as he became the Seahawks' premier target. 
- Some of the Cluster 2 receivers are there not only because of injuries to themselves but also 
  because of injuries to their starting quarterbacks. Jordy Nelson was hurt in 2017, but even in the 
  games he played he didn't do much because Aaron Rodgers missed most of the season as well.
- The style of certain offenses can be deduced from this data as well. Looking at the two 2019 Super Bowl 
  teams: Kansas City has two Cluster 3 receivers, which correctly leads us to believe that they have an 
  extremely high-octane passing offense. San Francisco on the other hand does not have any Cluster 3 
  receivers, leading us to believe that they are likely a running football team that relies on scheme to 
  move the ball through the air rather than top-tier receivers.
